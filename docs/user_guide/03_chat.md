# Chat

The Chat view is a modern, two-pane messenger that streams assistant responses and shows tool activity in a sidebar. You choose a specialist and render mode, and you must select a project to enable sending messages.

## Layout overview

- Left: Conversations — list of sessions with rename/delete. New creates a fresh session.
- Center: Chat pane — message history with streaming, attachments, copy, and regenerate.
- Right: Session details & Tools — step-by-step tool outputs and payloads (collapsible details per tool call).

## Requirements: select a Project

Chat is project-scoped. If no project is selected (via the app header), the composer is disabled and an inline warning appears.

## Compose and send

- Text: Enter message; press Enter to send (Shift+Enter for newline).
- Attachments: click the paperclip to attach images (PNG/JPEG) or text files (txt, md, log). Thumbnails and chips appear before send.
- Voice: click the mic to record; speech is transcribed via /stt and appended to the composer. The browser records audio, downsamples to 16 kHz mono, encodes a small WAV, and posts to /stt.
- Send/Stop: the arrow sends; while streaming, the button switches to Stop.
- Generate image: toggle to request an image response from providers that support image generation.

## Specialist and render options

- Specialist override: choose a named specialist or leave as orchestrator. When set, messages route to that specialist for the session.
- Render mode: markdown (default) or html, applied to assistant/tool content. HTML renders raw; markdown uses a syntax highlighter and copy buttons for code blocks.

## Sessions

- Create: New starts a session named “New Chat”; you can rename it inline.
- Select: click any conversation to load its messages.
- Rename: hover → Rename, then edit inline (Enter to save, Esc to cancel).
- Delete: hover → Delete on a conversation card.

## Messages and actions

- Roles: You, Agent, Tool (and System if present).
- Copy: copy any message content.
- Regenerate: available on the latest assistant message after a user turn, provided streaming is idle.
- Images: click an inline image to open the modal; view the file path when saved.

## Tool activity sidebar

- Shows each tool call with title, timestamp, streaming indicator, and error badge (if any).
- “View details” expands rendered arguments, payload, and any audio.
- Separate “Scroll to latest” control keeps tool output tracking independently of chat.

## Backend interactions

- Streaming uses the /api/prompt endpoint and provider streaming APIs. For streaming, tool schemas are purposefully omitted to avoid multi-step loops mid-stream.
- Non-streaming runs can dispatch tools when a specialist has tools enabled; the UI surfaces tool sink messages in the right pane.
- Session metadata and message history are persisted by the server; titles are generated by a lightweight model call using the first user message.

Troubleshooting
- “Select a project to run the agent”: choose a project in the top header.
- Mic icon disabled: browser cannot access microphone or a recording is already active.
- Regenerate disabled: there is no prior assistant turn to regenerate, or the model is still streaming.
