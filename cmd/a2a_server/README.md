**Explanation of How the Code Works**

- **Data Structures**: We define `TaskState`, `Task`, and `InMemoryTaskStore` to manage tasks. The `Task` struct holds task details, and `InMemoryTaskStore` provides thread-safe operations for task management.
  
- **A2AServer**: This struct handles HTTP requests to the server. It manages task creation and retrieval.

- **Request Handlers**: 
  - `handleTaskSend`: Accepts a task, stores it, and starts processing it asynchronously.
  - `handleTaskGet`: Retrieves the status of a task by ID.

- **Task Processing**: Simulates task processing by updating the task state with delays to indicate progression through states.

- **Server Initialization**: The `main` function initializes the task store and server, then starts listening on port 8080.

**Alternative Approaches**

- **Persistent Storage**: Instead of an in-memory store, tasks could be stored in a database for persistence across server restarts.
  
- **Concurrency and Load Handling**: Use worker pools or goroutines to handle multiple tasks concurrently, improving scalability.

- **Enhancements**: Implement additional features like SSE for streaming updates, and enhance error handling for more robust response handling.

- **Authentication**: Implement authentication mechanisms as defined in the JSON schema to secure the server.

This basic setup can be expanded with additional endpoints and features as defined in the JSON schema. The code handles basic task lifecycle management and can be used as a foundation for a more comprehensive implementation.
