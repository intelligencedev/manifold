### Explanation of How the Code Works

1. **Data Structures**: The `Task`, `JSONRPCRequest`, and `JSONRPCResponse` structures represent the JSON-RPC protocol data. `RPCError` is used for handling JSON-RPC errors.

2. **Client Initialization**: `NewA2AClient` initializes the client with a base URL and an HTTP client with a timeout.

3. **SendTask Method**: This method sends a task to the server by making a POST request to the `/tasks/send` endpoint. It handles JSON encoding and checks for HTTP errors.

4. **GetTask Method**: This method retrieves the task status by making a GET request to the `/tasks/get` endpoint. It decodes the JSON response into a `Task` object and handles errors appropriately.

5. **Main Function**: Demonstrates sending a task and retrieving its status after a delay, simulating task processing.

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Error Handling Enhancements**: Implement more sophisticated error handling, such as retry logic for transient network errors.

2. **Concurrency**: Use goroutines to handle multiple tasks concurrently.

3. **Configuration**: Allow configuration of the client (e.g., timeout, headers) via a configuration file or environment variables.

4. **Logging**: Integrate a logging framework for better observability and debugging.

5. **Validation**: Add validation for JSON-RPC responses to ensure they conform to expected structures before processing.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for interacting with the A2A server, with room for enhancements and customization based on specific requirements.
